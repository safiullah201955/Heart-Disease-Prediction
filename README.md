# Heart-Disease-Prediction

# Task Objective

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using clinical and demographic data. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and treatment planning.

# Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Heart Disease Dataset

Attributes: 13 clinical features (e.g., age, cholesterol, chest pain type, resting blood pressure) + 1 target variable (target: 1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence).

Rows: 303 patient records

Features include:

age, sex, cp (chest pain type), trestbps (resting blood pressure), chol (cholesterol), fbs (fasting blood sugar), etc.

# Models Applied

Decision Tree Classifier (using scikit-learn)

Model trained on 80% of the dataset and tested on the remaining 20%

# Key Results & Findings

Accuracy	 ~98%

AUC (ROC Curve) 	~0.99
